# Advent of Code 2021 solutions in Rust

It was my first year doing the AoC challenge. I decided to solve it all using Rust, as I had not used the language before and thought it would be a fun way to learn the language.

I did not strive for getting on any leaderboards, but I did finish all days before the 25th day was over. Completing all challenges in position 4745 on Dec 25th 2021.

## Input data
As there is no license shown for the input or sample data it has not been included in this repository.

For day 24 the input data is part of the solution, therefore the four `.c` files in the `24/` folder should be considered copyrighted by Eric Wastl ( https://adventofcode.com ), and they are only included in this repository as a teaching tool to show how to derive the solution from the input data.
